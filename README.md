Takeoff 2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several years ago, I started separating out my browser behavior. 

Firefox was for fun, Chrome was for development. As a result, whenever I came across something interesting or educational, I would bookmark it in Chrome. This turned into folders of folders of development info, assets, blogs, and more. While these bookmarks were well organized, I found myself forgetting what bookmarks I had saved or what I had even saved them for. 

"If they were so important," I asked myself, "I should remind myself what they were doing there in the first place." It was with this in mind that I began the search for an extension that would randomly load a bookmark and show it to me when I generated a new tab. This apparently didn't exist, so after Googling for a bit, I found a **[reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fjb0v/is_there_a_chrome_extension_that_can_set_my/)** that claimed to have solved this exact problem. The developer Ryan McGrath **[@ryanmcgrath](http://twitter.com/ryanmcgrath)** had created an extension, called "Takeoff", which I have now updated to work with any levels of folder structure and given an update to actually work with latest Chrome versions. (It was over 4 years old after all).

I plan on uploading this to the Google Chrome extensions store, but in the meantime, if you want to go ahead and fork it for other browsers, or whatever, please feel free, it is MIT Licensed after all.


To Install
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download it, unzip it somewhere, load it up in your extensions tab by loading
an "unpacked" extension. Will also be in Chrome Extensions soon.
